# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis


# Overview of Project:

This project involves the use of statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry.
All of the statistical analysis and visualizations is written in the R programming language.


## Background: 

A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Thomas High School's overall performance is seen to be better and jumps to the 2nd on the list, moving down a lot of schools. 

## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

- Math and reading scores by grade

Because Thomas High School ninth graders are labeled as nan in both math and reading. This creates a void in the data and makes them be seen as an outlier. Because those results make a big effect on the percentages. 

- Scores by school spending
From the graph we are able to see that the campaigns with goals less then 20k and between 35-45k have a higher percentage of successful campaigns while campaigns with goals greater then 45k or between 20-35k showed a higher percentage of failed campaigns. There was no record of any canceled campaigns therefore it was not shown on the graph. 


- Scores by school size


All the percentages went down for all the different sized school groups, especially shown on the small and medium sized schools. 



- Scores by school type

The percentages are also seen to be dropping for both school types, showing decreases in all subjects.
